Playing with data mining for unsupervised learning: coauthor analysis
in ACS journals.  Problem is, what patterns can we see in the distribution
of coauthorship in journal articles?  Can we build a "social graph" of 
scientists based on who collaborates on projects together?

journal_authors.py does data mining from ACS journals.
author_analysis.py is a beginning at doing this analysis.
