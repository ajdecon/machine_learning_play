Sandbox repository for me to play with machine learning code as I learn
about how this field works. Why's it on public github? Because I like having
a backup space, and I'm too cheap to buy a private repo for it. :)

Seriously: glance through this and play with it if you want, but this is a 
sandbox. Real stuff I build in the Stats or ML field will get spun out
into a separate project.

Also note: most of what's here *now* (22-09-2010) is based on the book
Programming Collective Intelligence, by Toby Segaran. I worked through his 
examples a few months back, and learned a lot; now I'm coming back to this
to learn some more. But the credit for what's here now is mostly his.
